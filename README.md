# Measuring-Hospital-efficiency---Length-of-stay-LOS-
 
Introduction about Framework for healthcare quality

In healthcare analytics, quality metrics are often classified across these six domains

`1-` Safety: Avoiding harm to patients from the care that intended to help.

`2-` Effectiveness : How well a healthcare service achieves its intended purpose.

`3-` Timeliness: Reducing delays for both those who receive and those who give care.

`4-` Patient centered : Providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preference, needs and values.

`5-` Equality: Providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal characteristics.

`6-` Efficiency : Avoiding waste including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas and energy.

For this case study, we'll be focusing on **efficiency**

## Measuring Hospital efficiency

**Length of stay (LOS)** is the duration in days for a patient stay in a hospital.

Reducing LOS can lower costs, increase capacity, and improve throughput.
Factors impacting LOS: 
- Patient age
- Health status
- Procedure
- Complications
- Mortality
- Risk
- Hospital size
